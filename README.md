## A Personal Note from Suren Sahaydachny

> We do not notice revolutions when they start quietly.

Offensive security is still fragmented across terminals, browsers, scanners, notes, scripts, dashboards, and tribal knowledge. The tools are powerful. The system around them is not. We ask talented people to copy, paste, context-switch, remember every finding, and manually conduct an orchestra that was never designed to play together.

That model got us here. It will not define what comes next.

CyberStrike is my personal open-source workstream for the next era of security: an AI-first orchestration layer that turns models, agents, methodologies, browsers, remote infrastructure, and specialist tools into one coordinated system. These are not disconnected utilities wearing an AI badge. They are parts of a security platform that can reason about the objective, choose the right instrument, preserve context, validate results, and keep a human in control.

The future will not belong to the team with the most dashboards. It will belong to the team that can embed intelligence into the flow of work so naturally that the complexity recedes and the outcome takes center stage.

I am open-sourcing this work because security infrastructure should be inspectable. Methodology should be shareable. Intelligence should not be trapped behind one provider, one model, or one company. The strongest systems will be built in the open, pressure-tested by the people who use them, and improved by a community bold enough to challenge the old assumptions.

I have been waiting my whole life for this moment—the point where AI moves from science fiction into our everyday reality. Now I get to build it.

| **Contact** | [surenpeter511@gmail.com](mailto:surenpeter511@gmail.com) |

> **Authorized security testing only.** CyberStrike is built for systems you own or have explicit permission to assess. Capability without judgment is noise; capability with accountability is leverage.

---

### Quick Start

```bash
npm i -g @cyberstrike-io/cyberstrike@latest && cyberstrike
```

That's it. CyberStrike launches a TUI in your terminal, asks for your LLM provider and API key on first run, and you're ready to go. Tell it what to test — it handles reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and reporting autonomously.

> **Already have a Claude Code or OpenAI subscription?** CyberStrike's intelligence layer sits on top of your existing AI subscription. No separate API costs — your current plan powers an entire pentest toolkit.

Explore the full documentation at [**docs.cyberstrike.io**](https://docs.cyberstrike.io) or visit [**cyberstrike.io**](https://cyberstrike.io) for demos and guides.

---

### Intelligence Layer

CyberStrike isn't just a wrapper around an LLM. It's an intelligence layer that transforms any AI model into an offensive security specialist.

**How it works:** When you connect your LLM provider, CyberStrike injects domain-specific context — OWASP testing methodology, vulnerability patterns, attack chain reasoning, and tool orchestration logic — into every interaction. The model doesn't need to know security; CyberStrike teaches it.

> **My design principle:** The AI should not be the star of the show. It should be the conductor behind the curtain — coordinating every instrument, preserving context, and making the hard parts feel inevitable.
>
> **— Suren Sahaydachny**

**What the intelligence layer provides:**

- **Schema normalization** — Structured output from any provider, regardless of response format differences
- **Context guard** — Prevents prompt leakage and keeps the agent focused on the current test phase
- **Provider auto-detection** — Automatically identifies your LLM endpoint and configures the optimal transport
- **Tool orchestration** — Chains security tools intelligently based on findings, not fixed scripts

**150+ AI providers and 5,300+ models supported out of the box:**

CyberStrike integrates with the entire AI ecosystem through 23 bundled SDK providers and 150+ providers via the [models.dev](https://models.dev) catalog. Here are the core integrations:

| Provider | Models | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Anthropic** | Claude 4.5, Claude 4 | Best performance with extended thinking |

### What Makes It Different

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Specialized Security Agents, Not Generic Chat**

CyberStrike ships with 13+ agents purpose-built for security domains. Each agent carries domain-specific methodology, tool knowledge, and testing patterns. The web-application agent follows OWASP WSTG. The cloud-security agent knows CIS benchmarks. The mobile agent uses Frida and follows MASTG/MASVS. They don't guess — they follow proven offensive security frameworks.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Intelligence Layer, Not Just an LLM Wrapper**

Most AI security tools are thin wrappers that send your prompt to an API. CyberStrike's intelligence layer normalizes outputs across 150+ providers and 5,300+ models, guards context between test phases, auto-detects your provider configuration, and orchestrates multi-step attack chains. The result: consistent, methodology-driven pentesting regardless of which model you use.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**150+ Providers, Zero Lock-in**

Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Amazon Bedrock, Azure, Groq, Mistral, xAI, DeepSeek, Cerebras, Cohere, OpenRouter, Together AI, GitHub Copilot — or run fully offline with Ollama and LM Studio. 150+ providers, 5,300+ models. You choose the model. You own the results. As AI models get better and cheaper, CyberStrike gets better with them. Switch providers in seconds without reconfiguring anything.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Remote Tool Execution with Bolt**

Your security tools don't have to run on your laptop. Deploy Bolt on one or many remote servers, pair with Ed25519 keys, and control everything from your local terminal. One CyberStrike instance can orchestrate dozens of Bolt servers — each with its own toolkit, network position, and attack surface access.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Agents

Switch between agents with `Tab`. Each one is a domain specialist.

| Agent | Focus | What It Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **cyberstrike** | General | Full-access primary agent — reconnaissance, exploitation, reporting |
| **web-application** | Web | OWASP Top 10, WSTG methodology, API security, session testing |
| **mobile-application** | Mobile | Android/iOS, Frida/Objection, MASTG/MASVS compliance |
| **cloud-security** | Cloud | AWS, Azure, GCP — IAM misconfigs, CIS benchmarks, exposed resources |
| **internal-network** | Network | Active Directory, Kerberos attacks, lateral movement, pivoting |

Plus **8 specialized proxy testers** that run automatically on intercepted traffic:

| Tester | What It Tests |
| --- | --- |
| **IDOR** | Object-level access control — can user A reach user B's resources? |
| **Authorization Bypass** | Vertical privilege escalation — can low-privilege users hit admin endpoints? |
| **Mass Assignment** | Unexpected writable fields — role, price, balance, userId in request bodies |
| **Injection** | SQL, command, LDAP, template injection across all input vectors |
| **Authentication** | Token validation, session fixation, credential exposure |
| **Business Logic** | Price manipulation, coupon reuse, race conditions, workflow bypass |
| **SSRF** | Internal host access via user-controlled URLs or redirect parameters |
| **File Attacks** | Path traversal, unrestricted upload, dangerous file types |

Each tester uses a **3-gate confirmation protocol**: execute a baseline request, execute the attack, compare responses. A finding is only reported when there is a measurable, reproducible difference — not on speculation. Duplicate findings (same endpoint + attack vector) are automatically suppressed across the session.

---

### Security Skills

CyberStrike ships with **7,600+ security skill files** — structured, Ed25519-signed methodology documents that give agents deep domain knowledge at runtime. Skills are lazy-loaded (one at a time, on demand) and statically injected into agent prompts.

**Skill categories:**

| Category | Skills | What They Cover |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Attack Methodologies** | 19 | JWT attacks, SSRF, SSTI, race conditions, request smuggling, cache poisoning, CORS, GraphQL, prototype pollution, XXE, WebSocket, subdomain takeover, host header injection, open redirect |
| **Post-Exploitation** | 5 | AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, Windows, macOS privilege escalation and persistence |
| **Compliance Frameworks** | 3 | CIS Benchmarks (AWS/Azure/GCP/K8s), NIST Framework, MITRE ATT&CK (Enterprise, Mobile, ICS) |
| **Domain Knowledge** | 8+ | Active Directory security, web security patterns, recon methodology, CI/CD attacks, Kerberos attacks, eBPF techniques |

Each skill includes testing procedures, payloads, tool commands, and CWE mappings. Skills are tagged with OWASP WSTG IDs, CIS control IDs, and chain relationships — so agents know which skills to combine for multi-step attack chains.

---

### HackBrowser

> Full documentation: [**docs.cyberstrike.io/docs/tools/hacker-browser**](https://docs.cyberstrike.io/docs/tools/hacker-browser/)

HackBrowser is CyberStrike's built-in Chromium browser. Start it from the TUI with `/hackbrowser`. As you browse, every HTTP request is captured and routed through the proxy-agent pipeline — no manual export, no Burp project files.

**Two capture modes:**

- **Manual** — Browse the target yourself. Log in as different users, navigate features, trigger actions. HackBrowser captures the real API traffic behind every click.
- **Autonomous** — Provide credentials for multiple accounts, set a scope, and let HackBrowser crawl automatically. It logs in as each user, maps reachable pages, and captures the traffic difference between roles.

**Role & credential discovery:**

As you browse with multiple accounts, CyberStrike builds a session context — a live map of discovered credentials, inferred role hierarchy, and which endpoints each role can reach. The 8 proxy sub-testers use this context directly: they know which token to use for a high-privilege baseline and which lower-privilege credentials to test with, without any manual setup.

```
Browser traffic → Proxy intercept → Orchestrator → 8 sub-testers (parallel)
                                          ↓
                               Session context (credentials, roles,
                               endpoints, functions) shared across all testers
```

**Scope control:**

Use `--scope` to limit testing to specific domains. CyberStrike automatically derives the registered domain (e.g. `--scope api.example.com` covers `api.example.com` but not `other.com`). Pass multiple `--scope` flags for multi-domain targets.

---

### Web UI & Remote Access

CyberStrike includes a full web interface. Run `cyberstrike web` and control your agents, MCP servers, Bolt connections, and vulnerability findings from any browser.

**Access from anywhere with Cloudflare Tunnel:**

```
Browser ──HTTPS──▶ Cloudflare Tunnel ──encrypted──▶ cloudflared (localhost) ──▶ CyberStrike Server
```

```bash
export CYBERSTRIKE_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
# Optional API/viewer credential with a strict read-only route allowlist:
export CYBERSTRIKE_OBSERVER_PASSWORD=your-observer-password
cyberstrike web
# In another terminal:
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:4096 run your-tunnel
```

If user or project configuration prevents startup, run `cyberstrike web --safe` to start recovery mode without those config sources. Managed administrator policy is still enforced.

**Why this is secure:**

- **Zero open ports** — CyberStrike binds to `localhost:4096`. `cloudflared` makes an outbound-only connection to Cloudflare's edge. No firewall rules, no port forwarding needed.
- **End-to-end encryption** — Browser to Cloudflare edge is TLS. Cloudflare edge to your machine is an encrypted tunnel. No plaintext leaves your network.
- **Password-protected API** — Every API request requires Basic Auth. Local requests on `localhost` bypass auth for convenience; remote requests via CF tunnel always require credentials (detects `X-Forwarded-For` / `CF-Connecting-IP`).
- **Read-only observers** — The optional `observer` account can read redacted activity, mission posture, topology, findings, and status, but cannot access configuration, secrets, raw events, PTYs, WebSockets, or mutation routes.
- **Your data stays local** — LLM inference runs on your hardware. CyberStrike processes everything locally. The tunnel is just a secure pipe.

**What's in the Web UI:**

| Tab | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| **Chat** | Full conversation with all 13+ security agents |
| **MCP** | Live MCP server status, health, and tool counts |
| **Bolt** | Bolt remote server connection monitoring |
| **Vulnerabilities** | Discovered vulns with severity, PoC, and impact |
| **Web Context** | Endpoints, roles, credentials, and functions discovered during active sessions |
| **Mission** | Methodology phases, coverage, blockers, attack chains, agents, and safe CTAs |
| **Topology** | Evidence-linked assets, Nmap hosts/services/routes, scan history/diffs, endpoints, identities, and findings |
| **Activity**        | Always-visible live status plus durable Agent/Tool/MCP/Bolt/Browser/PTY lanes, filtering, reconnect recovery, and JSONL export |
| **Memory** | Trust-ranked structured memory, FTS search, redaction, notes, and invalidation |

[**app.cyberstrike.io**](https://app.cyberstrike.io) is a hosted static page (no backend, no data storage) for convenience. Or self-host: clone the repo and serve `packages/app/dist/` from your own domain.

### Bolt — Remote Tool Execution

Bolt is CyberStrike's remote tool server. Deploy it on any VPS, cloud instance, or Docker container — then control it from your local terminal over MCP protocol with Ed25519 authentication.

**One CyberStrike, many Bolt servers:**

```
                                          ┌─────────────────────┐
                                     ┌───►│  Bolt Server #1     │
                                     │    │  nmap, nuclei, ffuf  │
┌──────────────────┐   MCP + Ed25519 │    └─────────────────────┘
│  Your Terminal   │   over HTTPS    │    ┌─────────────────────┐
│  CyberStrike TUI │ ◄─────────────►├───►│  Bolt Server #2     │
│                  │   Tool Results   │    │  sqlmap, burp, zap   │
└──────────────────┘                 │    └─────────────────────┘
                                     │    ┌─────────────────────┐
                                     └───►│  Bolt Server #3     │
                                          │  Custom toolkit      │
                                          └─────────────────────┘
```

- **Deploy anywhere** — VPS, Docker, Kubernetes, or bare metal with pre-built Kali images
- **Ed25519 key pairing** — No passwords, no shared secrets, no attack surface
- **Real-time streaming** — Results flow back to your TUI as they happen
- **Manage from TUI** — Add, remove, and monitor Bolt servers without leaving CyberStrike
- **Scale horizontally** — Run heavy scans from servers with better bandwidth while you work locally

---

All post-exploitation tools are agent-driven — they execute based on context and findings, not as fixed scripts.

---

### Installation

```bash
# npm (recommended)
npm i -g @cyberstrike-io/cyberstrike@latest

# bun / pnpm / yarn
bun add -g @cyberstrike-io/cyberstrike@latest

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install CyberStrikeus/tap/cyberstrike

# Windows (Scoop)
scoop install cyberstrike

# Linux / macOS (curl)
curl -fsSL https://cyberstrike.io/install.sh | bash
```

#### Build and deploy on Kali/Linux from source

Source deployments require the compiled binary, the matching HackBrowser worker, and the web bundle. Use the repository-pinned Bun version:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run --cwd packages/app build
CYBERSTRIKE_BUILD_TARGET=linux-x64 bun run --cwd packages/cyberstrike script/build.ts

# Installs the binary and its sibling HackBrowser worker.
./install --binary packages/cyberstrike/dist/cyberstrike-linux-x64/bin/cyberstrike

# Install the locally built Web UI.
install -d "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/cyberstrike/web"
cp -R packages/app/dist/. "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/cyberstrike/web/"

CYBERSTRIKE_SERVER_PASSWORD=change-me cyberstrike web --hostname 127.0.0.1
```

Use `linux-x64-baseline` on x64 CPUs without AVX2, or the corresponding `*-musl` target on musl-based distributions. Back up the installed binary, configuration, and data directory before replacing a production deployment.

For a persistent localhost-only deployment, install `contrib/systemd/cyberstrike-web.service` under `~/.config/systemd/user/`, create a mode `0600` `~/.config/cyberstrike/web.env` containing `CYBERSTRIKE_SERVER_PASSWORD`, then run:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now cyberstrike-web.service
```

Use an SSH or authenticated Cloudflare tunnel for remote access rather than exposing port 4096 directly.

### Who Is This For?

- **Pentesters** — Automate the repetitive parts. Let agents handle recon and initial testing while you focus on the creative attack chains that need human intuition.
- **Bug Bounty Hunters** — Faster reconnaissance, wider coverage, consistent methodology across programs. CyberStrike doesn't get tired at 3am.
- **Security Teams** — Run structured OWASP assessments with reproducible methodology. Get reports that map to standards your compliance team understands.
- **Security Researchers** — Extend CyberStrike with custom agents and MCP servers. The plugin system and MCP protocol make it a platform, not just a tool.

### Contributing

CyberStrike is a personal project with community-sized ambition. I am opening the doors because the future of security should not be designed in a closed room. If you believe agents can do more than chat, tools can do more than sit in silos, and open systems can outperform locked ecosystems, there is a place for your work here.

We welcome contributions across:

- **Security agents and skills** — New attack methodologies, testing patterns, vulnerability detection
- **MCP servers** — Connect new security tools and data sources
- **Knowledge base** — WSTG, MASTG, PTES, CIS methodology guides
- **Core improvements** — Performance, UX, provider integrations, bug fixes

Read the [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting a PR. All contributions must follow the project's [ethical use policy](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) — CyberStrike is for authorized security testing only.
